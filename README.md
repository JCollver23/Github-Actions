  ## Description
 
This project is a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline ensures that component tests using Cypress are executed when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch. The application is automatically deployed to Render when code is merged from develop to main.
